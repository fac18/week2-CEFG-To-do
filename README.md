# week2-CEFG-To-do

hey from your faves



## WHY
To practise using test driven development, pure functions and working as a TEAM <3

## WHAT
We wanted to create an app which was easy to use and pretty

## HOW (describing the journey to completion)

We started by splitting up the pure functions and tackling them by pair programming using test driven development.

We then used a combination of pair programming and mobbing to tackle the DOM Manipulation. 

As you will see from our code, this was A LOT of trial and error...:) 

We used a mobile first approach to keep our design minimal and used flexbox to center the form and added a background image we thought was jazzy 

## WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

Testing is initially a bit counter-intuitive but useful when you get your head round it!

We're much better at DOM manipulation 

We sometimes overcomplicated solutions - sometimes the most logical thing is actually the answer! 

## WHERE NEXT?

With more time we could add/fix some features, such as:

fix the slight glitchiness of the checkboxes
Achieve the stretch goal of sorting To Dos
Create a page with multiple lists 
Being able to edit ToDos
Making tests more granular
In terms of workflow: more commits with less lines of code :----) 

## HOW TO RUN OUR TESTS

clone our repo https://github.com/fac18/week2-CEFG-To-do

install npm on your computer by typing - npm install -g as a command

run npm test to check our tests
